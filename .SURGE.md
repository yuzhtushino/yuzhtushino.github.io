## About Surge

<https://github.com/sintaxi/surge>

Static web publishing for Front-End Developers.

This is the CLI client for the surge.sh hosted service. It’s what gets installed when you run `npm install -g surge`.

This CLI library manages access tokens locally and handles the upload and subsequent reporting when you publish a project using surge.

## Publish project

```
npm install -g surge
```

You will have to login / register (admin.txt).

Do `surge` in root folder where `index.html` resides:

```
D:
D:\server\serguei-uwp-dev
surge
```

Output:
```
surge
D:\server\serguei-uwp-dev
uwp-ac-demo.surge.sh
============
Success! Published and running at uwp-ac-demo.surge.sh
```

You will have to confirm project path with `Enter` and manually change randomly generated subdomain name!

## Remove domain

Best thing to do would be to run surge list, pick the ones you no longer need and then "teardown" that project:

`surge teardown uwp-ac-demo.surge.sh`

Tearing down a project is the equivalent of deleting the project.
